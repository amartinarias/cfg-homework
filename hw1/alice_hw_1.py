TASK 1

Write a class to represent a Cash Register.
Your class should keep the state of price total and purchased items

Below is a starter code:
------------------------
1. you can add new variables and function if you want to
2. you will NEED to add accepted method parameters where required.
For example, method add_item probably accepts some kind of an item?..
3. You will need to write some examples of how your code works.

TASK 2

Write a base class to represent a student. Below is a starter code.

Create a new subclass from student to represent a concrete student doing a specialization, for example:
